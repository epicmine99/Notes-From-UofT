# Notes From UofT
This repository contains all the notes I've taken in-class that I've decided to make public. These notes are constantly updating, so check on them often! I'm not responsible if any mistake I make impacts you in any way. I make no guarantees with the correctness of my notes, so take them with a grain of salt. If you find this repository useful, please give it a star. The amount of notes I take per course strongly depends on how it is taught.
