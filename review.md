### Project Name: PNYX
### Team Name, Team Number: Team 7, Project 25
### Github Link: [https://github.com/csc301-2024-s/25-pnyx](https://github.com/csc301-2024-s/25-pnyx)

### Project Summary:
PNYX is a music platform focused on discovering unreleased and exclusive tracks in a fun and 'gamified' way. This platform aims to present music without the bells and whistles of visual presentation, promotionial budgets, and other influencing factors that don't involve the content quality. It offers users a unique experience by allowing users to discover music using the ML system, purchase music and merchandise, and partake in a unique listening experience with plentify of options regarding genre, shuffling methods, and song name visibility. The platform uses a machine learning system for better tailored music recommendations and a fun a game-like discovery process using daily regenerating tokens, promoting content quality and discovery.

### Introduction & Overview of the problem and the product:
_* Were you able to understand clearly the problem that the project is trying to solve?_

_* Were you able to get an overview of what the project is about?_

_* Were you able to differentiate what the project does and how it differs from existing or prior work?_

_* Any points that would have helped you to get more information on this subject?_

The introduction does a great job at introducing me to the solution, less so the problem. While i can infer what the problem is given the detailed feature and explaination of what the product is, there should also be a seperate section detailing why the music platform exists in isloation from it's larger competitors like spotify and apple music; why is popularity a bad thing? is the metric not accurate for the most amount of people, or is it that this platform specifically targetting users that want a niche listening expeirence? that is what I understand from the demo video and readme, but specifically listing the pros and cons as well as target demographics would be helpful in painting the whole picture. Other than that, the project demo and general readme is described well; short and sweet, and the feature list is to the point without any needless wording. I was well able to understand what this music platform would look like and it's key draws, that being a more honest, gamified, and interactive listening experience with aditional functionality surrounding merchandise and payment options. In summary, I think adding a section that can detail the problem that the software aims to solve would be very helpful in understanding the need of this software, and in that section you can detail the differences between this new platform and existing solutions. 


### Demo of the application:
_* Were the ideas presented in the demo clear and easy to understand?_

_* Did the team demonstrate all the key features of their application in the demo?_

_* Did the demo help you in forming a good understanding of the application?_

_* Any points that would have helped you to get more information on this subject?_

Aesthetics look great, love the purple! the pages are all well populated and layed out. in terms of the core machine learning feature, its hard to verify that the algorithm works if all the inputs are pre-set. forward and back buttons are simple functionality which should be included. blind player looks great! sound quality is great! song reveal function works just as detailed. images for the song should be implemented as it is also basic functionality. perks page looks good aesthetically, but why do songs have quantity? is that a specific feature requested? otherwise I would remove it. does the progression bar representing how far you are in the song actually move? it starts at seemingly 10% into the song (at least thats what it looks like) but isn't shown to move. I think that the demo is good for the most part, but the actual product leaves a lot to be desired; the app should have probably completed basic functionality before moving onto the more impressive features; as a music playing app, basic music functionality is a nessessity.  

### Technical Discussion & Key Learnings:
_* Were you able to understand the technical aspects of the project?_

_* Do the key learnings presented by the team make sense, are concrete and achievable, and will help to improve the project?_

_* Any points that would have helped you to get more information on this subject?_

The graphic leaves a bit to be desired. I think the break up makes sense, but can be aesthetically better to represent the information. There is also simple, to the point bullet points but then long complicated sentences that really throw off my focus. It is also hard to read the longer sentences from the graphic. The frontend, backend, and machine learning explainations were very detailed and really helped me understand what the team was doing. The machine learning was a lot more detail, which I think was warrented due to it's higher technical nature; however, I wish the frontend and backend had more detailed graphics like the ML side to help better explain each sub area (the verbal explainations were great though). Key learnings were great, component breakup of react code is a very good thing to learn! backend key learning was fairly general and wasn't really a backend key finding but rather a communication problem; this was kinda the same key learning as the machine learning section. I actually disagree with the "too much research time" key finding; research is VERY important, and there is a fixed amount of research time that is required when learning new technologies. What might be more accurate to the problem is focused research and making sure you are researching what you'll acutally be implementing/using. 




### Project Documentation:
_* Was the project readme easy to follow and gives all the necessary details about the project?_

_* For a new user (such as yourself), how approachable and easy is it to read and follow the readme?_

_* Are there technical or major writing errors that prevents a good understanding or leads to confusion?_

_* Do you think there are gaps in the documentation or points that could have improved its quality?_

The frontend and backend readme do well to detail the installation instructions to get the respective part working locally. I couldn't find a user readme or a developer readme, which does leave a lot to be desired in the documentation aspect. I think for the developer, the code is commented well enough to understand the main features and how to contribute to them, and the demo video does a great job at explaining how to use the app, I just think maybe having a section in your readmes about the features in more granular detail would be helpful. For example, a developer readme could detail the library you guys used and why or maybe areas of the tech that is important for maintenance. The user readme should basically just be your demo video but written down, less of a need since the video does exist but it is helpful to have it in written format. The backend endpoints are well documented. 

### Project Deployment:
_* Were you able to follow the instructions and install the application on your device?_

_* Did the application run without any errors?_

_* Were you able to test at least the basic / most significant features of the application?_

_* Were there any edge cases that you feel the application doesn't consider?_

_* Is the UI of the application representative of a product similar to this project?_

_* Any points that would have helped to improve this aspect?_

### Misc.:
_* Are there any other points that you want to comment on / give your feedback?_

_* These could be points that were not captured above, but you think will help to improve the product quality._
