### Project Name: PNYX
### Team Name, Team Number: Team 7, Project 25
### Github Link: [https://github.com/csc301-2024-s/25-pnyx](https://github.com/csc301-2024-s/25-pnyx)

### Project Summary:
PNYX is a music platform focused on discovering unreleased and exclusive tracks in a fun and 'gamified' way. This platform aims to present music without the bells and whistles of visual presentation, promotionial budgets, and other influencing factors that don't involve the content quality. It offers users a unique experience by allowing users to discover music using the ML system, purchase music and merchandise, and partake in a unique listening experience with plentify of options regarding genre, shuffling methods, and song name visibility. The platform uses a machine learning system for better tailored music recommendations and a fun a game-like discovery process using daily regenerating tokens, promoting content quality and discovery.

### Introduction & Overview of the problem and the product:
_* Were you able to understand clearly the problem that the project is trying to solve?_

_* Were you able to get an overview of what the project is about?_

_* Were you able to differentiate what the project does and how it differs from existing or prior work?_

_* Any points that would have helped you to get more information on this subject?_

The introduction does a great job at introducing me to the solution, less so the problem. While i can infer what the problem is given the detailed feature and explaination of what the product is, there should also be a seperate section detailing why the music platform exists in isloation from it's larger competitors like spotify and apple music; why do we need another music platform? if the project and problem description could answer that question, I believe this write up would be more compelling. Other than that, the project is described well; short and sweet, and the feature list is to the point without any needless wording. I was well able to understand what this music platform would look like and it's key draws, that being a more honest, gamified, and interactive listening experience with aditional functionality surrounding merchandise and payment options. In summary, I think adding a section that can detail the problem that the software aims to solve would be very helpful in understanding the need of this software, and in that section you can detail the differences between this new platform and existing solutions. 


### Demo of the application:
_* Were the ideas presented in the demo clear and easy to understand?_

_* Did the team demonstrate all the key features of their application in the demo?_

_* Did the demo help you in forming a good understanding of the application?_

_* Any points that would have helped you to get more information on this subject?_

### Technical Discussion & Key Learnings:
_* Were you able to understand the technical aspects of the project?_

_* Do the key learnings presented by the team make sense, are concrete and achievable, and will help to improve the project?_

_* Any points that would have helped you to get more information on this subject?_

### Project Documentation:
_* Was the project readme easy to follow and gives all the necessary details about the project?_

_* For a new user (such as yourself), how approachable and easy is it to read and follow the readme?_

_* Are there technical or major writing errors that prevents a good understanding or leads to confusion?_

_* Do you think there are gaps in the documentation or points that could have improved its quality?_

The frontend and backend readme do well to detail the installation instructions to get the respective part working locally. I couldn't find a user readme or a developer readme, which does leave a lot to be desired in the documentation aspect. I think for the developer, the code is commented well enough to understand the main features and how to contribute to them, and the demo video does a great job at explaining how to use the app, I just think maybe having a section in your readmes about the features in more granular detail would be helpful. For example, a developer readme could detail the library you guys used and why or maybe areas of the tech that is important for maintenance. The user readme should basically just be your demo video but written down, less of a need since the video does exist but it is helpful to have it in written format. The backend endpoints are well documented. 

### Project Deployment:
_* Were you able to follow the instructions and install the application on your device?_

_* Did the application run without any errors?_

_* Were you able to test at least the basic / most significant features of the application?_

_* Were there any edge cases that you feel the application doesn't consider?_

_* Is the UI of the application representative of a product similar to this project?_

_* Any points that would have helped to improve this aspect?_

### Misc.:
_* Are there any other points that you want to comment on / give your feedback?_

_* These could be points that were not captured above, but you think will help to improve the product quality._
